Compiling the cpp file as a shared library
==========================================
To compile all apps, run

$ make

To adjust compiler and flags, see Makefile.

For the video demo, run the python script as

$ python video_demo.py path/to/video/file

The implementations are for a generic resolution.

For a sample video try

space - to toggle OpenCV/PolyMage mode
        (only 'harris' for now)
